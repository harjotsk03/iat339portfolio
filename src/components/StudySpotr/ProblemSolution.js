              Before starting this project, I faced the challenge of not having
              built a fully{" "}
              <span className="text-engineer-primary poppins-medium">
                hosted full-stack application
              </span>{" "}
              accessible to real users. This made developing both the front-end
              and back-end from scratch a new experience for me. Additionally, I
              recognized a common issue that students frequently encounter: the
              question of{" "}
              <span className="text-engineer-primary poppins-medium">
                "where should we study today?"
              </span>{" "}
              Students often struggle to find study spots that meet their
              needsâ€”whether it's having access to Wi-Fi, power outlets, or a
              quiet environment to focus.

              To address this, I created Study Spotr, an application that allows
              students to easily find the perfect study location nearby or{" "}
              <span className="text-engineer-primary poppins-medium">
                anywhere in the world
              </span>
              . This platform solves the problem by providing detailed
              information about study spots, including amenities like{" "}
              <span className="text-engineer-primary poppins-medium">
                WiFi, outlets, noise levels, and more
              </span>
              . With the ability to{" "}
              <span className="text-engineer-primary poppins-medium">
                rate and review locations, students can make informed decisions
                about where to study
              </span>
              , saving time and avoiding frustration. Built with the MERN stack
              (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and integrated with
              the Google Maps API, Study Spotr provides a seamless user
              experience, offering multiple ways to discover and explore ideal
              study environments.
